# Definitions

Any experiment with randomness can produce one **outcome** of the many 
possible,  denoted by the lowercase Greek letter Omega $\omega$.
The **outcome space**, denoted by the uppercase Greek letter Omega
$\Omega$, is the set, or collection of all possible outcomes.

A single **event** is a subset of $\Omega$, commonly denoted by increasing
order of uppercase alphabets, starting with $A$, $B$, etc. The empty set 
and the entire set $\Omega$ are both valid subsets.

Note that an outcome $\omega_1$ is different than the event
$A=\{\omega_1\}$, where the former is a single outcome, but the latter is
a set with a single element.

$P(A)$ is the probability that $A$ will occur.

If all $n$ outcomes in $\Omega$ are equally likely, then $P(A)$ is denoted
by $\text{number of outcomes where A occurs}/\text{number of outcomes in 
}\Omega$.
