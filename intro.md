# Welcome to CS70

This is a work in progress. The probability section is being worked on actively,
while earlier sections will likely take a bit longer to get done, as it is not
a focus for the final.

These notes are based on the official course notes for CS70, Summer 2020.
Credit goes to the UC Berkeley course staff for CS70 over the years, and the
purpose of these notes is to provide a summary of the official course notes with
just what you need to know.

These notes will largely forego examples, images and overly detailed
explanations in place of actual math.
